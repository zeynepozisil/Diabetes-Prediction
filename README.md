## Business Problem

We will develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.

It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.
